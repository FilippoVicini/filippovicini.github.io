## Who am I?
I study computer science at City University of London, and I'm passionate in the fascinating combination of computer theory, data science, and math. I have a wild side, too, so life isn't only about code and algorithms for me!

I love being outside in nature and I'm a huge sports enthusiast. I enjoy going on excursions and riding the waves with my kite or surfboard. I love to find that sweet spot where my passion and focus intersect, yet I'm also a dedicated worker.

I have always enjoyed working on side projects when I was occupied with my studies. I made a simple personal website where I may showcase my work .
